üîç Project Title: Data Professional Survey Breakdown ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard
üìä Project Description:
In this Power BI project, I explored and visualized responses from over 600 data professionals to understand trends in job roles, salaries, skill preferences, and career satisfaction. The dataset consisted of raw, uncleaned survey data collected anonymously. I handled all data transformation and visualization entirely within Power BI without any preprocessing in Excel‚Äîshowcasing real-time Power Query transformations and DAX calculations.

‚úÖ Key Highlights:
Data Transformation (Power Query):

Cleaned and simplified survey responses like job titles and programming languages by grouping and standardizing free-text entries.

Parsed salary ranges (e.g., ‚Äú$106K - $125K‚Äù) into numerical columns and computed average salary using DAX.

Removed and renamed irrelevant columns for improved model clarity.

Custom Calculations:

Created calculated columns and measures for average salary, average age, and average satisfaction scores.

Developed a custom column for average salary by extracting ranges and using numeric approximations.

Interactive Visualizations:

Summary Cards: Total number of respondents and average age.

Bar Charts:

Average Salary by Job Title

Favorite Programming Languages by Count

Treemap: Distribution of respondents by country.

Gauges: Satisfaction with work-life balance and salary (scale 0‚Äì10).

Pie Chart: Gender-wise salary comparison.

Stacked Column Chart: Difficulty in breaking into data roles, colored by response sentiment.

Design & Custom Theme:

Applied a consistent theme and custom formatting for readability.

Used slicers and tooltips for improved interactivity and storytelling.

Optimized layout for intuitive navigation and quick insights.

üîß Tools & Skills Used:
Power BI Desktop

Power Query Editor

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Data Cleaning and Normalization

Dashboard Design & UX

üí° Key Takeaways:
Gained hands-on experience with real-world messy survey data.

Practiced data modeling, transformation, and visualization end-to-end in Power BI.

Developed a portfolio-worthy dashboard that highlights insights into job satisfaction, salaries, skill trends, and geographical salary variance in the data profession.
